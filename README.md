## Clone DFO

### Summary

### 1.a) Explain your method?
I started by accessing Chrome Dev Tools and navigating to the Sources tab, where I found the pre-6.html file, which was the main HTML document for the page. I opened my text editor and copied that code into my index.html file. I followed these steps for the CSS files and placed them in their corresponding files within my project. 

I then grabbed all of the website's image assets from the sources tab in dev tools and renamed any files that did not link up with the code initially. 
### 1.b) How you would minimize the errors?

Keeping the same file names is one of the simplest and most important ways to ensure that no errors occur while cloning the code. 
### 1.c) If you would need to eliminate any scripts explain and why?

I would eliminate the Google GTM tracking scripts as they are customized for the original site. I would need to create a new GTM for the new site, customized to whatever the client's needs are. 
### 1.D) If you would replace scripts explain how & why?

I would replace the Google GTM scripts to whatever the cloned site needed, and would also customize the js files ( lib.min.js, site.min.js, pre-6.min.js ) to redirect to the buying order-a.html file.
